2. It's a year 2080 and multiplanetary travel is on the rise. Given an age on
Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds, calculate
Earth years of a 631,154,000 seconds year old Space traveller in Space
planets, given:
● Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
● Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
● Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years.
●●
Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years.
Eg:A Space traveller is 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say
that “Earth age : 31.69 Earth-years old - Mars age: 16.8 Earth-years old”.
